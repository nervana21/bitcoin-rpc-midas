# Bitcoin-RPC-Midas

Bitcoin-RPC-Midas provides a type-safe, async-ready client for interacting with Bitcoin Core's JSON-RPC interface. It is generated automatically from the bitcoin-cli help output and reflects the actual RPC methods supported by the node.

This crate is designed for developers building tools, tests, or applications that need a reliable interface to bitcoind across versions.

## Features

    ✅ Typed method signatures for each RPC

    🚀 Async support via tokio and reqwest

    🔍 Automatically derived from live node metadata

    🧪 Ideal for integration testing or development tools

    🧱 Supports multiple Bitcoin Core versions

## Example

```rust
use bitcoin_rpc_midas::BitcoinTestClient;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    let client = BitcoinTestClient::new().await?;
    let info = client.getblockchaininfo().await?;
    println!("{:#?}", info);
    Ok(())
}
```

## Installation

To install:

```bash
cargo add bitcoin-rpc-midas
